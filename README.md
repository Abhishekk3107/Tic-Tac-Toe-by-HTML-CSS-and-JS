# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with a 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
4. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark.
5. The game will check for a win or a draw after each move.
6. If a player wins, a message will be displayed, and the game can be reset by clicking the reset button.

### Game Flow

- The game starts with Player 1's turn.
- Players alternate turns by clicking on empty cells.
- The game ends when one player has three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when all cells are filled without a winner (draw).
- Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
